# barcode_labels
This R script can be used to create barcode labels for printings on Avery label sheets.

It is a modification of the shiny RStudio pluggin of package [baRcodeR](https://github.com/ropensci/baRcodeR).

It was built on R package [barcodeLabel](https://github.com/pinbo/barcodeLabel).

## Note
1. Please select "Actual size" while printing.
1. HP printers always shrink my printing area (tested on two different HP printers); Brother printers are perfect.
